# QUICK n RANDOM
a quick loading random music player without mp3 tag playlists  

most music players waste time to read mp3 tags of all files and make playlists even for random play. QUICK n RANDOM doesn't do that. it handles only a file list in the default music folder for random play but you can also choose a song in the list box.
